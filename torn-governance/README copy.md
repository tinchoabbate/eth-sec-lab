# TORN Governance

This is an educational proof-of-concept sandbox to learn about an attack in [TORN Governance](https://rekt.news/tornado-gov-rekt/).

The code does not attempt to reproduce the real exploiting transactions. Instead, it showcases a much simpler case to learn about the CREATE & CREATE2 patterns used to trick the system.
