## Mission

Our mission is to empower open source projects to maximize good in the world by helping them define and execute on their missions.

## Objective

Our objective is to focus on the mission we set out to accomplish, which we believe will produce an important social good in the world. Our standards are directed towards achieving this mission. We will conduct ourselves with professional integrity and set aside divisive discourse that doesn’t help us achieve our mission.

**Leadership principle:** Project leaders are responsible and authorized to make judgments and take appropriate actions to define the mission and keep the project in line with this mission.

**Mission focus:** We will focus our efforts on accomplishing the project’s mission, so that it is fulfilled to its highest potential.

**Creative conflict:** We acknowledge that discussions and disagreements are a natural part of problem-solving and should happen in a constructive way.

**The whole is greater than the parts:** We are a project with diverse opinions and fields of engagement, but we are here to focus on what unites us, instead of what divides us.

**Principle of charity:** We assume positive intentions of members, contributors, and policies.

We highly encourage contributors to resolve conflicts by directly reaching out to the other party or parties involved in the dispute.

Project leaders will make reasonable efforts to adjudicate incidents shortly after they are brought to their attention.

This code of conduct also applies to members and contributors who represent the project in non-project spaces, such as when contributors give a talk on behalf of the project at a conference. In official spaces, members and contributors should operate with decorum that reflects positively on the project, its objectives, and its community.
